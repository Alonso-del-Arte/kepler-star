## N

* **Natal chart** &mdash; A chart showing the positions of the Sun, the Moon and 
the planets at the time of a person's birth.
* **Noon chart** &mdash; A natal chart calculated with the assumption that 
someone was born exactly at noon local time in the place of their birth. 
(Watters, 2015, p. 7) The Moon is likely to be wrong, depending on how many 
hours there are between noon and the actual time of birth, but this assumption 
is unlikely to make a difference for the Sun or any of the planets. Astrologers 
like Joanna Watters believe noon charts can still be very valuable.
