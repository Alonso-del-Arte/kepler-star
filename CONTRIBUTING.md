# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2025 contributors

## General

This project requires a basic understanding of astrology beyond the Sun signs. 
A basic understanding of astronomy is also helpful. After all, astronomy grew 
out of astrology. 

It doesn't matter if you believe or don't believe that astrology has any 
predictive power in human affairs. It's okay if you're in the latter camp and 
still want to contribute to this project, as long as you don't try to impress us 
with how thoughtlessly automatic your skepticism of astrology is. As a skeptic 
of astrology, I will actually think less of you if you criticize astrology in 
any way that is not relevant to the topic at hand.

Therefore, anyone who tries to contribute to the project for the sole purpose of 
expressing unthinking disdain for astrology will have their pull requests 
rejected as spam or not helpful.

If you don't believe in astrology but want to contribute to this project, the 
right attitude with which to approach this project is perhaps the same way you 
would approach a project pertaining to Greek mythology.

After all, I have never known anyone to loudly proclaim that he knows the 
stories of Greek mythology are all fictional, as if that somehow made him edgy 
or interesting. And he would actually be interesting if instead he claimed to 
believe those stories as actual history.

## Technical

* You have to have Xcode, though it's okay to occasionally use Vim to edit files
that don't need to be recompiled.
* Make your own branch, name it after yourself, or after a feature if 
appropriate.
* Prefer small commits, and group commits into pull requests.
* Write meaningful commit messages. This is easier with smaller commits.
* Never delete tests, unless you have a very good and easy to explain reason for 
doing so (e.g., the class under test is deprecated and marked for removal). 
Deleting tests without explanation will be regarded as not helpful.
* You may refactor to comply with Swift naming conventions, but be kind with 
contributors who don't know the Swift naming conventions.
