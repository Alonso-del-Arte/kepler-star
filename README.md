# Kepler Star

WORK IN PROGRESS. Astrology app for the iPhone trying to practice astrology as 
astronomer Johannes Kepler did, or would if he had had the kind of computational 
power that we take for granted these days.

I am aware of the supernova SN1604 and the Kepler K2 telescope. This project has 
nothing to do with either of those.
