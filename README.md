# Kepler Star

WORK IN PROGRESS. Astrology app for the iPhone trying to practice astrology as 
astronomer Johannes Kepler did, or would if he had had the kind of computational 
power that we take for granted these days.

I am aware of the supernova SN1604 and the Kepler K2 telescope. This project has 
nothing to do with either of those.

## The basics of astrology

There are twelve constellations of the Zodiac.

* &#x2648; &mdash; Aries
* &#x2649; &mdash; Taurus
* &#x264a; &mdash; Gemini
* &#x264b; &mdash; Cancer
* &#x264c; &mdash; Leo
* &#x264d; &mdash; Virgo
* &#x264e; &mdash; Libra
* &#x264f; &mdash; Scorpio
* &#x2650; &mdash; Saggitarius
* &#x2651; &mdash; Capricorn
* &#x2652; &mdash; Aquarius
* &#x2653; &mdash; Pisces

From Earth's perspective, the Sun, the Moon and the other planets of the solar 
system move through the signs of the Zodiac, usually forward, occasionally in 
retrograde.

Astrologers believe that the positions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets at 
the time of a person's birth determine that person's personality.
