# Kepler Star

WORK IN PROGRESS. Astrology app for the iPhone trying to practice astrology as 
astronomer Johannes Kepler did, or would if he had had the kind of computational 
power that we take for granted these days.

I am aware of the supernova SN1604 and the Kepler K2 telescope. This project has 
very little to do with either of those.

I am also aware of some existing astrology apps, like Co-Star. The unique value 
proposition of Kepler Star will be that it will present its predictions as being 
directly based on mathematical calculations of the planets' positions and the 
supposed meanings of the planets and the signs of the Zodiac.

## The basics of astrology

There are twelve constellations of the Zodiac.

* &#x2648; &mdash; Aries
* &#x2649; &mdash; Taurus
* &#x264a; &mdash; Gemini
* &#x264b; &mdash; Cancer
* &#x264c; &mdash; Leo
* &#x264d; &mdash; Virgo
* &#x264e; &mdash; Libra
* &#x264f; &mdash; Scorpio
* &#x2650; &mdash; Saggitarius
* &#x2651; &mdash; Capricorn
* &#x2652; &mdash; Aquarius
* &#x2653; &mdash; Pisces

Astrology is reckoned from Earth's perspective. The Sun takes roughly a month to 
go through one sign of the Zodiac. The Moon takes roughly a month to go through 
all twelve signs.

So the Sun goes through all twelve signs in exactly a year, always moving 
forward. Mercury takes roughly a year to go through all twelve signs, spending 
about three weeks in each but sometimes going retrograde (meaning backwards). 

Retrograde motion is of course only an illusion caused by our perspective here 
on Earth. Mercury and the other planets all go around the Sun in the same 
direction always.

But of course the planets farther away from the Sun take longer to visit each of 
the twelve signs. It takes Neptune roughly 165 Earth years to go around the Sun, 
and Pluto, despite its orbit crossing Neptune's, takes almost two and a half 
centuries to go around the Sun.

When I started this project, Pluto was in Aquarius. As I write these words, 
Pluto is retrograde in Aquarius. And even if I take a few years with this 
project, Pluto will quite likely still be in Aquarius.

Thus Neptune and Pluto remain constant for a whole generation, and are therefore 
thought to influence an entire generation. By the time a given person turns 
30-years-old, the planetary positions for his or her birthdays are guaranteed to 
not match those of when he or she was born, certainly differing in the outer 
planets even when matching the Moon and the inner planets.

Astrologers believe that the positions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets at 
the time of a person's birth determine that person's personality. Furthermore, 
the current positions of the planets in relation to a person's natal chart are 
believed to affect that person's experiences currently.

Many people also believe that two persons' natal charts can be used to determine 
their compatibility as romantic partners. This gives rise to the term 
"star-crossed lovers."

And yet most people, even those who actually believe in astrology, focus 
entirely on the Sun signs. Horoscopes in the newspapers seldom mention the 
current positions of the planets, and one is left to wonder if the author of the 
horoscope was actually trying to make predictions based on the positions of the 
planets or was simply coming up with predictions out of thin air.

Each sign of the zodiac is associated with one of the four elements which 
ancient people believed all things were made of in varying proportions: fire, 
earth, air and water. The way these assignments from signs to elements were made 
seems to me to be somewhat arbitrary:

* **Fire**: Aries, Leo, Saggitarius
* **Earth**: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn
* **Air**: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius
* **Water**: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces (Watters, p. 48)

Of course the stars that make up the constellations, such as the ones of the 
Zodiac, are actually made up mostly of hydrogen and helium.

Astrology is frequently met with automatic, thoughtless skepticism. It's one 
thing to make logical arguments based on the claims posited by astrology. But 
for one to simply denigrate the whole practice while completely disregarding the 
history shared by astrology and astronomy is to be hardly less ignorant than one 
accuses astrology's believers of being.
