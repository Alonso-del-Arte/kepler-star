# Kepler Star

WORK IN PROGRESS. Astrology app for the iPhone trying to practice astrology as 
astronomer Johannes Kepler did, or would if he had had the kind of computational 
power that we take for granted these days.

I am aware of the supernova SN1604 and the Kepler K2 telescope. This project has 
nothing to do with either of those.

## The basics of astrology

There are twelve constellations of the Zodiac.

* &#x2648; &mdash; Aries
* &#x2649; &mdash; Taurus
* &#x264a; &mdash; Gemini
* &#x264b; &mdash; Cancer
* &#x264c; &mdash; Leo
* &#x264d; &mdash; Virgo
* &#x264e; &mdash; Libra
* &#x264f; &mdash; Scorpio
* &#x2650; &mdash; Saggitarius
* &#x2651; &mdash; Capricorn
* &#x2652; &mdash; Aquarius
* &#x2653; &mdash; Pisces

Astrology is reckoned from Earth's perspective. The Sun takes roughly a month to 
go through one sign of the Zodiac. The Moon takes roughly a month to go through 
all twelve signs.

So the Sun goes through all twelve signs in exactly a year, always moving 
forward. Mercury takes roughly a year to go through all twelve signs, spending 
about three weeks in each but sometimes going retrograde (meaning backwards). 

Retrograde motion is of course only an illusion caused by our perspective here 
on Earth. Mercury and the other planets all go around the Sun in the same 
direction always.

Astrologers believe that the positions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets at 
the time of a person's birth determine that person's personality. Furthermore, 
the current positions of the planets in relation to a person's natal chart are 
believed to affect that person's experiences currently.

And yet most people, even those who actually believe in astrology, focus 
entirely on the Sun signs.

Astrology is frequently met with automatic, thoughtless skepticism. It's one 
thing to make logical arguments based on the claims posited by astrology. But 
for one to simply denigrate the whole practice while completely disregarding the 
history shared by astrology and astronomy is to be hardly less ignorant than one 
accuses astrology's believers of being.
