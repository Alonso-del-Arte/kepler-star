#  Astrological terminology

## A

* **Aspect** &mdash; An angle of significance between two planets in an 
astrological chart, or between two charts of one planet.

## B

## C

* **Conjunction** &mdash; When two planets are aligned exactly, or almost 
aligned within a variance of two or three degrees.

## D

## E

## F

## G

* **Geocentric** &mdash; Centered around the Earth, such as traditional 
astrology.

## H

* **Heliocentric** &mdash; Centered around the Sun.

## I

## J

## K

## L

* **Luminary** &mdash; Either the Sun or the Moon.

## M

## N

* **Natal chart** &mdash; A chart showing the positions of the Sun, the Moon and 
the planets at the time of a person's birth.
* **Noon chart** &mdash; A natal chart calculated with the assumption that 
someone was born exactly at noon local time in the place of their birth. 
(Watters, 2015, p. 7) The Moon is likely to be wrong, depending on how many 
hours there are between noon and the actual time of birth, but this assumption 
is unlikely to make a difference for the Sun or any of the planets. Astrologers 
like Joanna Watters believe noon charts can still be very valuable.

## O

* **Opposition** &mdash; An aspect of 180 degrees. From Earth's perspective, the 
two planets oppose each other with Earth in the middle.

## P

* **Planet** &mdash; A stellar body other than Earth that obviously moves 
relative to Earth, unlike Earth, the position of which was considered to be 
fixed, and unlike the stars that make up the constellations of the Zodiac, which 
were thought to never move. Pluto is considered a planet under this definition, 
but so are the Sun and the Moon. Note that this is the astrological definition, 
not the astronomical definition.
* **Planetoid** &mdash; A planet-like stellar body that does not quite meet 
astronomers' criteria for a planet under the astronomical rather than 
astrological definition.

## Q

## R

## S

* **Sesquiquadrate** &mdash; An aspect of 135 degrees.
* **Square** &mdash; An aspect of 90 degrees.

## T

* **Trine** &mdash; An aspect of 120 degrees.
